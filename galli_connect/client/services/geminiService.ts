/**
 * **SIMULATED GEMINI API CALL**
 * 
 * This function mimics calling the Gemini API to get route optimization advice.
 * In a real-world scenario, this would make an actual network request to Gemini.
 * 
 * The prompt sent to the model would be structured like this:
 *
 * `
 * You are a transport logistics expert for a local shuttle service in India.
 * Your task is to analyze a list of passenger trip requests and identify demand hotspots 
 * and create an optimal, single-loop route for a shuttle driver to maximize pickups.
 *
 * Here are today's trip requests in JSON format:
 * ${JSON.stringify(tripRequests, null, 2)}
 *
 * Based on this data, provide a response in a valid JSON format, adhering to this schema:
 * {
 *   "demandHotspots": [
 *     {
 *       "location": "Area Name",
 *       "demandScore": <a number between 1 and 10 indicating demand intensity>,
 *       "summary": "A brief reason why this is a hotspot."
 *     }
 *   ],
 *   "optimizedRoute": {
 *     "routeName": "AI-Generated Optimal Route",
 *     "stops": ["Stop 1", "Stop 2", ...],
 *     "estimatedDuration": "X mins",
 *     "summary": "A brief explanation of the route's logic."
 *   }
 * }
 * 
 * Ensure the route starts near the earliest pickup locations and creates a logical path covering the hotspots.
 * `
 *
 * We will simulate this by returning a hardcoded response that matches the expected output structure.
